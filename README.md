# WeatherDataAnalysis
This Python tool fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API for multiple U.S. cities, processes it by removing unnecessary fields, filters data based on temperature thresholds, and exports the cleaned and formatted data to a spreadsheet. It includes features like temperature unit conversion and city-state mapping.
